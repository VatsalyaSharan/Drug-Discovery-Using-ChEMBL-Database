We have presented a compact version of our project in the Jupyter notebook.

BEFORE RUNNING THE NOTEBOOK
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Environment in which the Notebook will be running should have RDKit Preinstalled along with Jupyter Notebook.
Generic Libraries like scikit-learn, seaborn etc should also be installed.

To run the notebook & import the data, must install chembl_websource_client module for python.
It can be installed with the following command in the terminal;

>>> pip install chembl_webresource_client

With this library installed, and a stable connection, the code can be run without 
further issues. 

We have provided the datafile in the folder but there is no need for importing data from any of the files.

####################################################################

In some of the code blocks, we have looped regression through the different random states.
This can take some time. If you just want to go through the code, you can skip these cells.
